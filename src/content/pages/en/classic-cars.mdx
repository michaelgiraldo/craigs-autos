On a classic, the interior is the part you live with. Even a great exterior can feel unfinished if
the seats don’t match the panels, the headliner is tired, or the cabin looks like it was repaired
in separate eras.

We help classic owners in San Jose repair what’s worth saving and rebuild what needs a reset—so the
interior reads as one consistent, finished cabin.

## What classic interior work can include

Classic projects vary, but most involve restoring consistency across multiple surfaces.

Common interior work includes:

- Seats (repairs, recovering, foam/spring support work)
- Headliners and overhead trim
- Panels and trim pieces that are worn, loose, or no longer match
- Carpet and interior surfaces that have aged unevenly (vehicle-dependent)
- Staged interior work or a full refresh when multiple surfaces are tired

If you’re not sure what’s original, what’s been repaired, and what’s been replaced, that’s
normal. The first inspection is where the plan becomes clear.

## The part that separates “done” from “patched”

A classic interior looks right when it feels like one set:

- Seams align and panel shapes feel intentional
- Materials match in tone and texture
- The interior reads as one “set,” not a mix of different eras of repair

Many classic interiors suffer from patchwork repairs. Fixing one seat panel is easy. Making the
entire cabin look consistent is the craft.

## Partial restoration vs full refresh

### Partial restoration makes sense when

- One seat or one area is clearly damaged.
- The rest of the interior matches and is in good condition.
- You want to preserve as much original material as possible.

### Full refresh makes sense when

- Multiple surfaces are worn, faded, or mismatched.
- Previous repairs don’t match.
- You want a unified finish that looks like the interior was done as one project.

A full plan often creates the most “finished” result.

## Materials for classics (what matters most)

Material choice is where classic projects can go wrong.

What matters most:

- Tone under daylight (faded interiors can shift)
- Texture and grain that fits the era
- Consistency across seats, panels, and headliner

During an estimate, we’ll talk through whether you want period-correct, “looks factory,” or a
tasteful update that still fits the car.

---

## Staged work (how to avoid mismatched steps)

Many classic owners don’t do the whole interior at once—and that’s fine. The key is making early
repairs work with the later plan.

When you tell us the finished look you want, we can help you prioritize so the car doesn’t become a collection
of “close enough” repairs over time. In practice that means keeping materials, tone, and details
consistent from one phase to the next.

## Project planning (so it stays consistent)

To move quickly, it helps to bring:

- What you want the interior to feel like when it’s done (period-correct vs clean refresh)
- Photos of the interior in daylight
- Notes on any previous repairs, if you know them

If you’re building the car in stages, tell us. Interior work is easier when scheduled in the
right order.
