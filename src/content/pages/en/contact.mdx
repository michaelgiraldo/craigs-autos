Call is fastest. Text is great if you want to send photos first. Either way, we’ll ask a few quick
questions so you get a real quote (not a guess), and we’ll tell you whether you’re looking at a
repair, reupholstery, or a larger interior refresh.

If you’re texting, you don’t need perfect photos. A couple clear daylight shots plus your
year/make/model is usually enough to start.

Most customers come from San Jose and the surrounding South Bay. If you’re farther out, we can
still help as long as you can bring the vehicle (or the relevant parts) to our San Jose shop.

## What we’ll ask for a quote

If you have it handy, these details help us quote accurately:

- What you want fixed (seat tear, seam split, sagging headliner, convertible top issue, full interior)
- Which areas are affected (driver’s seat, passenger seat, rear, headliner, top)
- Whether comfort is affected (collapsed foam, uneven support)
- Your priority (blend-in match vs clean refresh vs full refresh)
- Vehicle basics (year/make/model)

If you don’t know whether you have leather, vinyl, or cloth, that’s normal — we can identify it
when we see it.

## What to text (quick version)

If texting is easier, send:

Text us at <a href="sms:+14083793820">(408) 379-3820</a> (or <a href="tel:+14083793820">call</a> if that’s easier), then send:

- Year / make / model
- What’s wrong (seat tear, seam split, sagging headliner, leaking top, etc.)
- 2–4 photos in daylight (one wide shot + one close-up)
- If matching matters, one photo of the “good” area you want it to blend with

---

## Photo checklist (helps us quote correctly)

Good photos save time and prevent surprise quotes. Try to take them in daylight.

### For seats

- Wide shot of the full seat (shows panel layout)
- Close-up of the damage (tear, seam, worn bolster)
- Side angle showing the seat profile (foam collapse shows here)
- Photo of the matching seat/area you want it to blend with

### For headliners

- Wide shot showing how much is sagging (front/back/entire roof)
- Close-up near edges, lights, visors, and any bubbling
- If there are stains, one photo showing the full roof area

### For convertible tops

- Exterior photos with the top fully closed (both sides + rear)
- Close-ups of seams/edges where water or wind gets in
- Interior photo showing where you notice moisture

### For classic interiors / full projects

- Several wide shots of the cabin in daylight
- Close-ups of mismatch areas or previous repairs
- Notes on whether you want period-correct vs tasteful refresh

## When an in-person inspection matters

Photos are great for a first look. An in-person inspection is usually the right move when:

- You need a very close match (color + grain/texture)
- Comfort is affected (foam collapse, uneven support)
- The issue spans multiple surfaces (seats + headliner + trim)
- The top doesn’t sit evenly and the leak path is unclear

If you’re not sure, call — we’ll tell you what’s worth bringing in.

---

## If you’re comparing quotes

Make sure you’re comparing the same work:

- Is the quote for a **panel repair**, a **full seat**, or **multiple seats**?
- Does it include **foam/bolster work** if the seat feels collapsed?
- Is the **material choice comparable** (leather vs vinyl vs cloth), and is matching a priority?
- For headliners, is it a **proper replacement** vs a temporary adhesive “quick fix”?
- For convertible tops, is the plan a **repair** or a **full replacement**?

If two quotes are far apart, ask what’s included so you’re comparing the same job.

---

## What happens next (no surprises)

1. We talk through what’s going on and what the right fix is (repair vs reupholstery vs full refresh).
2. If it needs an in-person inspection, you bring the vehicle to the shop.
3. We confirm materials and match expectations and provide a clear estimate and timeline.
