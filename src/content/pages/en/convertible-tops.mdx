## Common convertible top problems

### Leaks and water intrusion

Leaks can come from aging material, seam failure, worn seals, or a top that isn’t sitting evenly.
The first step is figuring out where water is getting in and why.

### Cracked, faded, or brittle material

When material gets brittle, small fixes tend to fail again. At that point, replacement is usually
the more dependable path.

### Loose fit, flapping, or uneven tension

Loose tension can make the top noisy and more likely to leak. Fitment matters as much as material.

### Wear at stress seams and edges

High-stress seams and edges are common failure points. When multiple areas are failing, the top is
often at the end of its usable life.

## Repair or replacement?

This is the question behind most calls: is it worth repairing, or is replacement the cleaner fix?

### Repair can make sense when

- Damage is localized.
- Material is still strong overall.
- The top fits well and the issue is limited.

### Replacement is usually the better option when

- Material is brittle, cracked, or heavily faded.
- Multiple seams are failing.
- The finish will still look tired after spot repairs.

The point isn’t a temporary patch. It’s a top that looks right and keeps the cabin dry.

## What we check during inspection

To give you a real recommendation, we look at:

- The condition of the top material (brittle, cracked, worn-through areas)
- Stress seams and edges
- How the top sits side-to-side when closed
- Where you’re seeing water/wind (and under what conditions)

If the issue is mechanical (frame, motors, latches), we’ll tell you—those aren’t upholstery fixes.

---

## Fabric vs vinyl (what to choose)

Convertible tops are typically fabric or vinyl. The best choice depends on the car’s original
style and what you want the finished look to be.

### Fabric

- Often preferred for a refined look
- The finish depends heavily on fit and edge work

### Vinyl

- Durable and practical
- Texture and finish still matter for a “belongs on the car” look

## Where leaks usually show up

People often describe a leak as “the top leaks,” but what matters is **where the water shows up**
inside the car and when it happens (parked in rain, driving, car wash, highway speed).

Common leak situations include:

- Water appearing near the front corners or side windows (often related to how the top meets seals)
- Moisture near seams and edges where material is aging or stitching is failing
- Water showing up after driving at speed (wind can change how water moves across the top)

If you can tell us where you’re seeing moisture and under what conditions, it speeds up diagnosis.

## What a good finished top looks like

A quality convertible top job isn’t just “new material.” You should see:

- Even tension side-to-side when closed
- Clean edges and finishing details where the top meets trim and seals
- Straight seams that don’t wander across the roofline
- A top that closes and sits evenly without looking twisted

Those details are what make the car look finished—and what usually determine whether a repair will
still look good after a season of sun and use.

---

## What affects cost and timeline

Convertible tops vary a lot by vehicle and design. Pricing and turnaround usually move with:

- Vehicle/top style and complexity
- Material choice (fabric vs vinyl) and availability
- Whether the job is a localized repair or a full replacement
- Condition of the existing top and how many areas are failing
- How much finishing detail is involved around edges and trim

After inspection, we’ll give you clear options and a realistic timeline.

## Fast quote (call or text)

To speed up an estimate, text:

- Year / make / model
- Whether it leaks (and where you notice it)
- 3–5 photos in daylight:
  - Exterior with the top fully closed (both sides + rear)
  - Close-ups of seams/edges where water or wind gets in
  - One interior photo showing where you notice moisture
