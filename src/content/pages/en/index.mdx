    q: "Do you serve San Jose and the South Bay?",
    a: "Yes. We’re in San Jose, and most customers come from San Jose and nearby South Bay cities. If you can bring the vehicle (or the relevant parts) to our shop, we can help.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does auto upholstery cost?",
    a: "Cost depends on what you want done, materials, and the condition of what’s already there. The fastest way to get an accurate quote is to define the job clearly: one panel, one seat, or a full interior.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you make it match?",
    a: "Matching is the point. Color is one part—texture/grain and clean seam alignment are what make the repair blend instead of standing out.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it better to repair or replace?",
    a: "If the material is brittle or the damage is spread across multiple panels, replacement often produces a cleaner, longer-lasting result. If the issue is localized, a targeted repair can make sense.",

Interior problems are the kind you notice every day: a driver’s seat tear that keeps growing, a
headliner that starts to droop, vinyl that’s cracking in the sun. Call or text Craig’s Auto
Upholstery in San Jose and we’ll give you a clear recommendation—what can be repaired cleanly,
what’s better recovered, and what we need to quote it accurately.

## What brings people in

Most customers don’t show up with a big “interior project.” They show up because one problem is
making the car feel worn—and they want it fixed in a way that looks intentional.

The most common reasons people call:

- A seat seam split or torn panel (often the driver’s seat)
- A seat that looks okay but feels flat or uneven (foam/support)
- A sagging headliner that keeps getting worse
- Interior trim/panels that no longer match
- A convertible top that leaks, flaps, or looks tired
- A classic interior that needs to look consistent again

If that’s you, start with a quick [call (408) 379-3820](tel:+14083793820) or
[text (408) 379-3820](sms:+14083793820). We’ll ask a few questions, and if you’re texting, we’ll
tell you which photos help most.

## What we repair (automotive upholstery only)

We work on interiors. That means you’re talking to a shop that thinks about **fit, match, and
finish** all day, not one that treats upholstery as a side job.

Common projects include:

- **Seats:** torn seams, split panels, worn bolsters, collapsed foam
- **Headliners:** sagging fabric, bubbling, staining, poor previous “quick fixes”
- **Interior trim:** panels that look mismatched or worn
- **Convertible tops:** worn material, leaks, loose fit
- **Classic interiors:** consistent restoration work where details matter

## Repair vs reupholstery vs refresh (how we recommend work)

Most customers want the same outcome: **it should look right up close and feel right every day**.
The right approach depends on the condition of the surrounding material and how strict you want the
match to be.

### Repair (targeted)

Repair is often the right move when damage is localized and the rest of the material is still
strong. The best repairs are the ones that don’t draw your eye because the panel sits correctly and
the match is handled carefully.

### Reupholstery / recovering

When material is cracked, brittle, or failing across multiple panels, small repairs can quickly
turn into mismatches. Recovering a seat (or the affected section) is often the clean reset: one
consistent choice, clean seam alignment, and a finish that reads like it belongs.

### Refresh (staged or full)

If an interior has aged unevenly—seats, headliner, and trim all tired at once—or has a history of
piecemeal fixes, we can help you stage the work so the cabin looks consistent instead of “one more
new panel” every time you fix something.

If you’re not sure, that’s normal. A quick call gets you to the right category.

## Materials: leather vs. vinyl vs. cloth (and what matters for your car)

People often ask “what’s best?” The better question is: **what will match the car and hold up for
how you use it**.

### Leather

- Looks premium and can be the right choice for higher-end interiors.
- Matching **color and grain** is the make-or-break detail.
- Repairs need to blend; otherwise the seat looks like it has “one new panel”.

### Vinyl

- Durable, practical, and often the best value for high-use vehicles.
- Great choice when you want a clean look that is easy to maintain.
- Matching texture matters as much as matching color.

### Cloth

- Comfortable and common on daily drivers.
- Matching weave and tone is key to avoiding an obvious repair.

If you don’t know what’s currently on your seats, we can identify it quickly during inspection.

## What affects price (so you can predict the estimate)

A good upholstery estimate is not random. Price typically moves with:

- **Job size:** one seat panel vs. one seat vs. a full interior
- **Material choice:** leather, vinyl, cloth, and how close a match is required
- **Foam condition:** foam rebuilds and bolster work add time but change comfort dramatically
- **Complexity:** stitched details, multiple panels, and tight curves take more labor
- **Condition:** brittle material tends to require replacement instead of small patch work

We give clear options so you can decide what makes sense.

---

## Timeline: what’s realistic

Most upholstery timelines are driven by **job size** and **material selection**. Small repairs can be
straightforward; full interiors naturally take more planning. During your estimate, we’ll give a
realistic timeline based on the work and the materials chosen.

## What to send for a faster quote

To get an accurate quote quickly, send:

- Year / make / model
- What’s wrong (seat tear, sagging headliner, leak, mismatch)
- 2–4 photos in daylight (one wide shot + one close-up)
- If matching matters, one photo of the “good” area you want it to blend with
