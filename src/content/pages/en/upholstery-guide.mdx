    q: "Is a sagging headliner a fabric problem?",
    a: "Usually no. The foam backing and adhesive are what fail first, so reattaching fabric only lasts if the backing is still solid.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you rebuild seat foam without reupholstering?",
    a: "Yes. If the cover is still in good shape, foam rebuilds can restore comfort without changing the visible material.",
  },

    q: "What photos help you quote upholstery work?",
    a: "Year/make/model plus a wide shot, a close-up of the damage, and a side-angle photo showing sagging or seat height.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does upholstery work usually take?",
    a: "Headliners can be short-turnaround once materials are ready. Seat rebuilds and multi-panel work usually take longer because of fitting and test work.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is vinyl always cheaper than leather?",
    a: "Not always. Material grade and labor complexity matter more than labels. Vinyl is often lower maintenance, but price depends on what’s involved and material quality.",

          <span class="details-card__summary-text">Foam backing breaks down, so adhesive can’t hold.</span>
        </summary>
        <p>Most headliners are fabric laminated to thin foam on a rigid board. Heat breaks the foam into powder, so the adhesive no longer has a stable layer to bond to.</p>
        <p>Spray glue or pins can hold briefly but fail once the foam is crumbling. If sagging is broad or bubbly, the durable fix is to remove the board, strip foam residue, clean the backing, and recover with high-temp adhesive. Edge sag tends to spread; stains or a warped board push the job toward replacement.</p>

          <span class="details-card__summary-text">Collapsed foam/support makes the seat feel low.</span>
        </summary>
        <p>Comfort comes from foam shape and density plus the support layer (springs, webbing, or molded frames). Over time the foam compresses, loses rebound, and collapses unevenly, especially on the driver’s side.</p>
        <p>A new cover doesn’t restore structure. Foam rebuilds often fix comfort without replacing the cover, but if the seat’s shape changed over time, the cover may need repair or replacement to fit correctly again.</p>

        </summary>
        <p>The seat edge takes repeated sliding friction and compression every time you get in and out. It wears first and shows cracks where the material flexes most.</p>
        <p>If the foam is soft, surface fixes don’t hold; the panel stays under tension and fails again. Rebuilding the foam and replacing the panel is the durable path.</p>

        <p>Door panels are layered: a skin, adhesive, and a backing board. Heat near glass softens adhesives, and moisture can warp the backing.</p>
        <p>Once the backing distorts, re-gluing fights the shape. Lasting repairs restore or replace the backing and re-skin with the correct tension and adhesive.</p>

      <h3>Repair vs reupholstery vs replacement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Repair (localized):</strong> fix a seam or small tear; best when surrounding material and foam are solid.</li>
        <li><strong>Panel replacement:</strong> replace a damaged panel (common for bolsters); match depends on age and grain.</li>
        <li><strong>Reupholstery:</strong> replace the cover and rebuild structure; best when multiple panels are failing or foam work changes the shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Replacement covers/kits:</strong> cosmetic improvement; rarely fix comfort or structural issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Foam-first thinking</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Comfort comes from foam/support, not the cover.</li>
        <li>Foam rebuilds can be the whole job if the cover is still healthy.</li>
        <li>If foam changes the shape, the cover may need repair or replacement to fit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>One seat vs matching sets</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Single-seat repairs are fine for daily drivers and budget-first projects.</li>
        <li>For a uniform look, plan staged updates; new material can read differently from aged material.</li>
