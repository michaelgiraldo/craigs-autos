## What good upholstery work looks like in photos

### Seat repairs and reupholstery

Good seat work looks tight and intentional:

- Seam lines run straight and symmetrical
- Bolsters regain their shape (not “flat” or wrinkled)
- New panels blend in color and texture/grain

### Headliners

A good headliner looks smooth from every angle:

- No waves, bubbles, or droop
- Clean finishing around lights, visors, handles, and trim
- Color tone that feels natural in the cabin

### Convertible tops

Convertible top work is judged by how the top sits when closed:

- Even tension side-to-side
- Clean edges and consistent seams
- A closed top that sits properly against the frame

### Classic interiors

Classic interiors are about consistency across the cabin:

- Materials that look like a set (not piecemeal)
- Stitching and detailing that feels period-respecting
- A unified interior “read” when you step back

## A quick craftsmanship checklist (use this on any shop’s photos)

Even if you’re looking at photos online, you can spot good work quickly:

- **Seam alignment:** seams straight, corners meet cleanly
- **Panel fit:** panels lie flat with even tension, especially on curves
- **Edge finishing:** clean edges near trim, switches, and hardware
- **Match quality:** the repair doesn’t give away a different grain/texture
- **Seat profile:** seat looks supportive, not still collapsed

---

## What a “before / after” should show (even without fancy photos)

Whether you’re looking at our examples or any shop’s, a solid before/after set should show:

- The damaged area no longer pulls your eye first
- Seams and lines look intentional (not wandering)
- The seat or panel sits tight — no bunching, no loose corners
- If foam was an issue, the seat profile looks restored

If a photo hides the area you care about, ask for a closer angle. Good work can handle close-ups.

## If you visit in person, inspect these details

Seeing work in person is the fastest way to judge quality. Look for:

- **Corners and transitions:** where panels meet, where curves change, where trim begins
- **Left/right symmetry:** especially on front seats and bolsters
- **Edge finishing:** near switches, handles, and hardware cutouts
- **Match under light:** move a step to the side and see if the tone shifts

## Want examples similar to your car?

The fastest way to get relevant examples is to text us a couple photos of your issue and your
year/make/model. If matching is important, include one photo of the “good” area you want it to
blend with.

We can also show examples in person when you bring the car to the shop.
