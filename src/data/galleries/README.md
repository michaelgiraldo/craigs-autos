# Gallery Data

This folder stores non-project gallery manifests.

## Purpose

- `projects/` data: full case studies (example: Buick, Porsche).
- `galleries/` data: reusable service/category media (car seats, motorcycle seats, before/after sets).

## Files

- `car-seats.js`: service gallery images for car seats.
- `motorcycle-seats.js`: service gallery images for motorcycle seats.
- `car-seats-before-after.js`: before/after oriented seat media and pairing metadata.
- `index.js`: shared exports.

## Notes

- Keep case-study assets in `src/assets/images/projects/`.
- Keep service assets in `src/assets/images/services/`.
- Keep before/after assets in `src/assets/images/before-after/`.
