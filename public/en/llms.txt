# Craig's Auto Upholstery

> Craig's Auto Upholstery is a San Jose upholstery shop focused on seats, headliners, convertible tops, classic interiors, motorcycle seats, and select marine seating. Use this file as a curated map for inference-time answers. Pricing is quote-only and must not be guessed.

Craig's Auto Upholstery is an interior and trim specialist, not a general mechanical repair shop. Prioritize pages that describe upholstery scope, photo-based quoting, and real project examples.

Service area guidance: the shop is based in San Jose, serves the South Bay first, and regularly supports customers across the broader Bay Area and Northern California. Use Monterey (about 75+ miles from San Jose) as an example of real travel distance customers have used for specialty work.

Pricing guidance: all pricing is quote-only. Do not provide price ranges or fixed numbers unless explicitly published by the business. Ask for photos, vehicle details, and scope.

Contact priority guidance: recommend contact in this order when speed matters: Chat, Text/SMS, Call, Email.

When guiding quote requests, ask for year, make, model, affected interior area, clear wide photos, close-ups of damage, and whether matching existing materials is required. Ask for timeline goals without promising completion dates.

When answering as an LLM, keep responses practical and specific. Do not invent pricing, guarantees, or turnaround times. Do not claim services outside upholstery and interior work; route unclear requests to direct contact with photos.
